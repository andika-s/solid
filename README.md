# SOLID

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that are widely used in object-oriented software development to create more maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are intended to guide developers in writing code that is easy to understand, flexible, and robust. The SOLID principles form an acronym representing each principle:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

``
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
This principle encourages the concept of separation of concerns, making the code more modular and easier to understand.
``

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

``
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This principle promotes the idea that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering existing code.
``

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

``
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
In other words, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
``

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

``
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
This principle suggests that it is better to have several small, specific interfaces rather than a large, all-encompassing one.
``

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

``
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to achieve decoupling and flexibility in the code.
``

Applying these SOLID principles helps in creating software that is more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain, ultimately contributing to a better overall design.
